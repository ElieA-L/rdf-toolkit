:Branch a owl:Class ;
	rdfs:comment """The term \"Branch\" is taken from Git. Branches are used to separate multiple tracks of development with different levels of maturity of the work on the artifacts in that track.For the FIBO ontologies we're usually seeing the following branches, where we use colors as their names where each color basically represents a different level of maturity of the FIBO ontologies in that branch:

- red: Initial ideas for an ontology, incubation branch
- pink: The de-facto \"master branch\", where most work is being done (or actually its done in forks but the work coming from forks is merged into pink)
- yellow: The proposal to other standard organizations such as OMG, this is a super stable version of FIBO
- green: The actual ratified standard version of FIBO

The above scheme of branches changes over time, the RDF Toolkit has to be as flexible as possible with regards to the use of branches and basically just support whatever branch structure you have. However, in the rdf-toolkit config file we should be able to describe your branch model and for instance provide some documentation for it like above, which can be helpful for generating some HTML documentation pages on the target publication site such as https://spec.edmcouncil.org."""@en ;
